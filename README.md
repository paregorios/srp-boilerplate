Boilerplate for Syriac Reference Portal (SRP) Digital Publications
====================================================================

This repository contains website boilerplate for digital publications
to be created by the Syriac Reference Portal (SRP) project 
(http://syriaca.org). 

It is customized from an HTML5 Boilerplate + Twitter Bootstrap 
template, created via http://www.initializr.com/ on 16 May 2014.

Bootstrap is licensed under the terms of the Apache License v2.0
http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.

HTML 5 Boilerplate is licensed under the MIT License.

The distro via Initializr did not come with license or copyright 
files, but some of the relevant source files contain copyright
and credit and license assertions and links. Those interested in
what we have changed and adapted should, for the time being, 
consult the commit history in the git repos at 
https://github.com/paregorios/srp-boilerplate.

Todo:
------

Add copyright and license statements to files that don't have
them (this implies deciding how we will license our content
in a way that is compatible in both spirit and letter with the
terms of the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses ... which may not be
easy since we are not a lawyer).
